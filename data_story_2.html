	<h1>Headline: Data Shows Disparity Among Boroughs for Babies Born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</h1>

	<h4>While most NYC boroughs’ opioid fell since the pandemic, is it resurging in some? </h4>

	<p> Reports from The New York State Department of Health SPARCS shows the rate of babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NARS) had decreased in most boroughs of New York City from 2016 to 2021. While these decreasing numbers in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens are grounds for optimism, the troubling trend of babies being born with NAS has not subsided as significantly in the Bronx and Staten Island.

	<p>At the start of 2018, the numbers of NAS babies born in all boroughs dropped, some by over 75%. However, in 2020, numbers shifted upward for the Bronx and Staten Island. </p>

<p>According to Dr. Awilda Torres, the Unit Director of Inwood Community Services’ Comprehensive Outpatient Addiction Program (COAP) in Inwood, data trends don’t always show the complete picture. For example, during the pandemic, many people stayed home, which meant fewer records were kept during that time.</p>

<p>“How would you have known what really was happening? We know only of people that ended up in the ER or that kind of stuff,” said Dr. Torres, a 30-year veteran of the program. </p>

<p>As far as why the data shows disparity between boroughs, Torres wonders if it’s possible that we still don’t have all the data. </p>

<p>“I think only years from now we'll see.”</p>

<p>Professor Lori Hoepner of SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University School of Public Health says more people may have moved to Staten Island during the pandemic, increasing the population. But, census records show only a slight rise in additional residents. 
</p>
<p>Dr. Hoepner says “They all seem to be declining from 2020 on,” referring to the chart. “I would think that has to do with the changes in opioid availability and prescriptions for opioids.”  
</p>

<p>According to Hoepner, the uptick in NAS babies born in Staten Island and the Bronx is not a concern. 
</p>

<p>“The data is optimistic overall,” she said.
